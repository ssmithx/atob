Need to revisit this.
Shipper can require reputation from the livery agent.  So when an agent says he wants to get the package,
the shipper can review the reputation of the agent and approve them.
They could also auto approve over a certain reputational rating.
Upon approval, the payload is encrypted to the agents npub and sent to them and this contains the precise
location and any specific instructions.
