Welcome to <insert new dev here>
I was at a music festival and this would definitely be something that could be used for the
music industry
Go over last weeks notes.  Maybe talk through the flow some more so devs can get started.

Absolutely define MVP on this call.  We can have cool stuff all day but we need the basics
that we can show at vegas

Yena: website?  stickers?  blog?
I would love a swissgerman blog we can translate.
I don't know if you want to write? Or get others.  Make a whole culture of hodl wave riding.
hodl wave riders is the essence of this.  Save your bitcoin.  Earn bitcoin.  Use your biitcoin.
