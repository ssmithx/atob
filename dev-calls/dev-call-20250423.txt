Welcome to <insert new dev here>
I was at a music festival and this would definitely be something that could be used for the
music industry
Go over last weeks notes.  Maybe talk through the flow some more so devs can get started.

Absolutely define MVP on this call.  We can have cool stuff all day but we need the basics
that we can show at vegas

MVP: minimum viable product
#1 "post" package - Location, "pretend cost", destination
#2 view available packages - open map, see packages
#3 acknowledge package pickup - open app, click "I picked it up"
#4 Receiver acknowledges delivery.  "pretend payment"

We need: (for dev to vibe code)
private nostr relay
app (pwa) that connects to relay
app can pull map data (open maps?)
pull public nostr profile (reputation score)
- maybe quick coding of score, pull follower count/following 
  count proportion, posts/reply, ZAPS!
payment simulator?
Present QR to receiver that links to PWA/acknowledge page

Payment side (shad)
Fedi mint? Escrow? (plugins?)


Yena: website?  stickers?  blog?
