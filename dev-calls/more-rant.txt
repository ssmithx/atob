A to B
What we are talking about is a revolution in:
coordination
communication
commitment
incentives

Coordination:  we have never had a system where every aspect of
the delivery system can be broken apart and have costs assigned
We can bill by the hour, mile, payload, or driver.

Communication:  with A to B you can always contact the person
in possesion of the package.  You can increase your bid indicating
priority or importance.  You can specify instructions on both ends

Commitment:  Each aspect of a delivery is ensured and backed up
by reputation or money.  They are the same.
Time, reputation and money

Incentives:  If I want a specific driver, I can bid it
If I want a specific route, I can bid it.  I can go by slow boat
fast plane.  I can have things picked up during airport layovers.
