Manifesto2
A to B is getting people from where they are to earning in Bitcoin

The first relationship is sponsor/sponsee
You need to find people in your area and talk to them about earning Bitcoin.  Onboard them to the app and link up as a sponsor.
Each get a badge.  Reputation grows for sponsors as well.
With a neophyte badge and a link to a sponsor, the new bitcoiner can bid on jobs in the app.  
Neophytes are not able to perform deliveries, only accept small jobs in their area.  
A neophyte can also talk to neighbors about posting jobs on A to B and get referrals.
Sponsors collect a small % of the neophytes earnings to incentivise the relationship.  Encourge the neophyte and try and drum up business in the area.
Community organizers can create Bitcoin Actions:
eg. Clean a park:  request 20 members to come.  20 spots are created in A to B and primarily neophytes can grab those spots.
All actions are funded and all members are paid.
You might raise 200,000 sats to clean the park and each member gets 10,000
Neophytes get badges and build their reputation as they perform jobs.
When they are ready to start doing small deliveries, the sponsor will train them and promote them to Novice Courier.
New jobs will appear that are available for novices.
Once a courier has done enough jobs, they can get sponsorship.
A sponsor stakes an amount of Bitcoin on a courier and gets a % of the jobs.
Novices can only take low trust and low value deliveries.
Once a courier has advances to CypherPunk stage and has sponsors, they can begin delivering high value, high trust packages.
After courier, we have drivers...I'm going to need a bigger manifesto.
