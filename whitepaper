A to B Whitepaper
Our modern high time preference lifestyle has led to single use trips, single use postage, and single use spaces.
We have the tools, willingness, and understanding of a life lived by thermodynamically sound principles to start
better oragnizing how we travel, how we transport and deliver packages, and how we use our warehouses, spare rooms, 
garages and parking spaces.
Bitcoin culture has the ability to redifine ownership, liability, and responsibility: for small items we use 
occationally, like scooters, and camaras, and for large items that could be better utilized like cars trucks 
and travel vans.
With A to B, you can rent your scooter for the day, ride shotgun on a road trip to San Diego, or bring a package 
for the Detroit meetup and it will damn sure get to Tampa.

A to B is a bit like a market place where people are bidding on rides or package delivery.  On the other side are 
people who want to pick up side jobs and generally better utilize their petrol or time for sats and friends.
Routes need to be predesigned to some extent based on availability and willingness.
Longer segments can be made up of smaller segments but willrequire greater coordination.
All routes can be double blind.
Social reputation via nostr or something less gay.
Advertised collateral lockup for higher value items like electric scooters and cars.

Simple Usecase:  Alice posts an offer for a ride to Philly from Harrisburg for 10,000 sats and Bob picks her up 
on his way from Pittsburgh.

Complex Usecase:  Alice is driving to North Carolina from Boston, so she advertise her route on A to B.
Bob is in Virginia and is going to Tampa and bids 30,000 sats on his trip.
Alice can agree to pick up Bob in Virginia for 10,000 sats, or might counter 12,000 because it not on the way.
Rod in Maryland also has a package for Tampa that they offer 10,000 sats for and now Alice can pick that up and 
hand it off to Bob when she picks him up.
